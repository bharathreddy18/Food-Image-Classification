# 🍔 Food Classification System with Flask

This project is a **Food Classification Web App** built using **Flask**. Users can upload food images, select a deep learning model (Custom CNN, VGG16, or ResNet50), and get predictions with nutritional information.

## 🚀 Features
- 📸 Upload food images for classification which are listed in the web app interface
- 🧠 Choose from 3 models: Custom CNN, VGG16, ResNet50
- 📊 View model performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- 🥦 Get nutritional information for the predicted food class

## 🛠️ Installation
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bharathreddy18/food-classification-app.git
cd food-classification-app
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash

```

---

## 🚦 Usage
### 1. Run the Flask App
```bash
python app.py
```
Access the app at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### 2. Upload an Image and Select a Model
- Upload a food image
- Select a model (CNN, VGG16, or ResNet50)
- View the predicted class, nutritional information and selected model metrics

---

## 🧪 Model Information
- **Custom CNN:** Trained on 34 food classes with high accuracy.
- **VGG16 & ResNet50:** Transfer learning models pre-trained on ImageNet.

### 📊 Model Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score (from `metrics.json`)
- Displays True Positives, False Positives, etc.
