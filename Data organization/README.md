### what should i do now?
- Now you go the data with yourself in **.zip** format.
- Extract all files inside the zip folder.
- Training model on a whole lot of images might get very difficult if you do not have GPU in your Laptop.
- Inorder to make it easy for us just for learning purpose we train on 200 images for every class and 50 for each validation and testing.
- So, to extract the images from the main file and to store the required images in the new directory run the file **images_extraction.py** in your virtual environment.
- Now, the images for model building and evaluation must be ready with you.
